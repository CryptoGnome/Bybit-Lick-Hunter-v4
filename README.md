Lick Hunter v4 is a full rewrite of LickHunter using some of the skills I have learned in the past two years and fully async compatable in Node JS. I have also released all of the source code in hope that if other users want to contribute to the project or add new features it is avaialable to them.

*Using a VPS can ensure high uptime and is much more stable than running on your own PC*

### Quick Linux Setup Steps:
*run each of these one at a time in the terminal, and wait for each to complete*

```
apt install npm
```

```
npm install n -g
```

```
n stable
```


```
apt install git
```

```
git clone https://github.com/CryptoGnome/Bybit-Lick-Hunter-v4.git
```

```
cd Bybit-Lick-Hunter-v4
```

```
npm install
```

```
cp example.env .env
```


*edit .env to the setup you wish to run you can learn more about the settings int the next section below*

```
sudo npm install pm2 -g 
```

```
pm2 start app.js
```

```
pm2 monit 
```


*Using pm2 will allow the bot to catch restarts and run after you close the server, if you are familiar with linux and would prefer to use screen you could also do that.*

### Using the dockerfile:

To run the bot as docker container just do it this way

```
docker build -t lick-hunter .
```

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 --name lick-hunter-container lick-hunter
```

*Dont forget to set your api inside the dockerfile*

```

# Set environment variables for .env file
ENV API_KEY=apikeyhere

### API settings for all features

To prevent error with fetch balance and similar you should check the API settings so that all features of the bot can be used. If you have the error 10004 = signing error, you should simply create a new API data

USDC Contracts and Account History rights may be for later features. An IP whitelist is also necessary for the withdraw function
